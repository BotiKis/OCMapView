 Note for OCMapView developers:
 Every algorithm has to be a class method which returns an array of OCAnnotations or a subclass of it. 
 OR for future releases
 They can be instance methods if they run asynchronously. The instance holder needs to implement the delegate protocol and the method needs to call the delegate.
